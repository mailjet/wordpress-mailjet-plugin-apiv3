 * @return string
 */

function updateMailjetSubscriptionEmailParameters($emailData) {

function useCustomConfirmationEmail($templatePath) {
    return './custom_subscription_path.php';
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code>
/**
 * Use SMTP headers to send emails with a specific transactional template
 * and leverage templating language to supply dynamic content to the template
 */
 
add_filter('wp_mail', 'my_wp_mail', 99);
function my_wp_mail($args) {
    /* Provide the transac template id */
    $args['headers'] .= 'X-MJ-TemplateID:123456' . "\r\n";
    /* Enable templating language */
    $args['headers'] .= 'X-MJ-TemplateLanguage:1' . "\r\n";
    /* Send template errors to this recipient */
    $args['headers'] .= 'X-MJ-TemplateErrorReporting:admin@your-site.com' . "\r\n";
    /* Send data to the template. The vars must be defined in the template in order to accept data */
    $args['headers'] .= 'X-MJ-Vars:' .
        json_encode(
            array(
                "var1" => $args['subject'], 
                "var2" => ($recipient->first_name) ? $recipient->first_name : false, 
                "var3" => $args['message']
            )
        )  
        . "\r\n";
